1.	Exercise 1.14
The following columns would need to be changed:
	a.  In the Student table the Major column.  In the course table the Course_number, and the Department columns. 
 In the Section table the Course_number column.  In the prerequisite table the Course _number and the 
 Prerequisite_number columns. 
	b. Yes, my solution would be to eliminate the corresponding prefix that exists in the course_number column and instead use the department column to identify the class.  You would have to add a department column to both the Section and Prerequisite tables.  For Example in the Course table under the column Course_number CS1310 would be changed to 1310 and the class would be identified by the department column.

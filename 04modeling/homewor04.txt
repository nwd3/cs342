1.
	a. The relation is in 1NF because there are no multiple values (definition of 1NF).
	I will show that the relation violates BCNF:
	The canidate key would be Book_title, Book_type, and Author_name.
	The relation is not in BCNF because of this functional dependency:
	Book_type → List_price.  In this functional dependency the key on the left is not a superkey and thus violates BCNF (definition of BCNF).
	The relation is not in 4NF by the same reasoning as above.  A relation that is not in BCNF can not be in 4 NF.

b.
	I split apart Book into three tables so that the functional dependencies could be described by super keys.
I then assigned an id to Book and author so that each book and author could be uniquely identified.  I did this because I assumed it 
would be possible to have two authors with the same name and title of the book.  Thus this allows me to remove any conflicts of that nature.  Furthur creating an 
author_id allows me to assign multiple books to one author without adding the author's name to every book record eliminating redundant information.

Normalization:
	Book( book_id,author_id, Book_title, book_type)(primarykey:book_id)

	Author( author_id, Author_name, Author_affil)(primarykey:book_id)

	Book_Listing(listing_id,book_type, List_price)(primarykey:book_id)

So that the functional dependencies and proofs are:
Book
	1.book_id-→author_id, Book_title, Book_type
	2. The canidate key is book_id
	3. the canidate key is on the left

Author
	1.author_id→ Author_name, Author_affil
	2. The canidate key is book_id
	3. the canidate key is on the left

Book_Listing
	1. book_type list_price
	2. The canidate key is book_type
	3. the canidate key is on the left
 
2.
	a. Book_name and edition 
	b. You can tell that from year to year based on the book there are multiple authors 
with respect to the edition and the year.  Thus the book depends on the multiple authors from 
year to year creating a multivalued dependency.
	c. 
	author(Book_name, Author)
	edition(Book_name, edition)
	Year(Book_name, year)
	This is now in 4NF
	Book_name->author
	Book_name-> edition
	Book_name->year
Only trival multivalued dependencies.

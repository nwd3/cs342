Run the Intellij IDEA J2EE tutorial: Developing a Java EE Application. Note the following as you go through the tutorial sections, saving answers to the questions in a notes.txt file in the root of your new project structure.

What is a WAR file?
a war file is a decompressed web application archive


You should now have a GlassFish server running to which Intellij can (“remotely”) deploy your WAR. What’s the difference between “exploded” and non-exploded WAR files?
"an exploded war file is one where you use a local folder with a war/ear file inside
non-exploded means that you are "deploying a WAR/EAR" file to your application server"

 Compare and contrast EAR and WAR artifacts.
ear "is a file format used by Java EE for packaging one or more modules into a single archive so that the deployment of the various modules onto
 an application server happens simultaneously and coherently. It also contains XML files called deployment descriptors which describe how to deploy the modules."

war "JAR file used to distribute a collection of JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, static web pages 
(HTML and related files) and other resources that together constitute a web application."

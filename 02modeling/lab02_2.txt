Exercise 2.2

a.
I would say it is possible I would implement the following code in the Movie table area:
votes float,

CONSTRAINT ch CHECK ((year > 1900) 
AND (votes >1000 AND score IS NOT NULL))
);

etc..

b. This might be very necessary if say a structure of a id changes
say a company sometimes uses id numbers that have to be greater than
9000
but othertimes it uses id's less than 3000
thus if you are able to alter the constraints you can ensure reliability with your
data entries.

   1. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?
  In 1970 Ted Codd of IBM research wrote a paper describing his invention of the relational model.

    Explain the following terms:
        relation:The table is called a relation. Defined as a set of tuples. 


        attribute:A column header.


        domain: A domain is a set of values that are indivisible as far as the formal relational model is concerned.

        n-tuple: A n-tuple is an ordered list of n values t=<v1,v2,...,vn>.

        NULL value: NULL is used to represent a missing value but that ist usually has one of three 
		different interpretations value uninown value not available or value not applicable.

        primary, foreign, candidate and super keys:
			
			Foriegn Key: A set of attributes FK in a relation schema R1 that references relation R2 if it satisfies the following rules:
							1. The attributes in FK have the same domains as the primary key attriutes PK of R2 the attributes FK are said to reference or refer to the relaton R2.
							2. A value of FK in a tuple t1 of the current state r1 either ccurs as a value of PK for some tuple t2 in the current state r2 or is NULL in the former case we 
							have t1 = t2 and we say that the tuple t1 references or refers to the the tuple t2.
							
							Example: (pg73) In the employee relation the attribute Dno refers to the department for whic h an employee works; hence we designate Dno to be a foreign key of Employee 
							referencing the Department relation.  This means that a value of Dno in any tuple t1 of the employee relation must match a value of the primary key of departme-the Dnumber
							attribute-in some tuple t2 of the department relation.
			
			Super key: A superkey specifies a uniqueness constraint tha no two distinct tuples in any state r of R
				can have the same value SK, where SK is a subset of attributes. IE: The attribute set {Ssn} is a key of STUDENT 
				becasue no two student tupes can have the same value fo Ssn.  Any set of attributes that includes Ssn--for example,{Ssn,Name,Age} is a superkey.
				We should not make NAME a key because two students can have the same name.
			
			Canidate Key: In general a relation schema may have more tha noe key in this case each of the keys is called a candiate key.
				For example the CAR relation has two canditate keys: Liscense_number and Engine_serial_number. It is common to designate one of the candat keys as the primary key which will
				be defined next.
			
			Primary Key: This is the candidate key whose values are used to identify tuples in the relation. The attrinutes that form the primary key aof a relation schema rre underlined. 
		
		referenced and referencing records
			Referenced records are those that have been refrerenced and are stored referencing refers to the process of referencing.

    Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.
		Tuples in a relation are not ordered but attribute values in a tuple are because the data is in afle which record is aon a disk neccessitating order.

    Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?
		No because each value is "atomic" whic means it is not divisible into components within the framework of the basic relational model.

Chapter 6 (focus primarily on Sections 6.1–6.2 & 6.4) — Make sure that you know how to:

    Create tables with specified constraints, including primary/foreign key, not-null, domain and value-check constraints.
    Use the DML commands: INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.
    Distinguish the ON DELETE actions: SET NULL, CASCADE.

Unit 1 assumed that you remember how to write basic queries (from CS 262). If n

a.
Store.put stores the "key-value record in the Oracle NoSQL database using the put(Key key, Value value) method in KVStore" the record 
is stored in a "single document file" where as (http://www.toadworld.com/platforms/oracle/w/wiki/10894.storing-json-in-oracle-nosql-database-using-avro-schemas,  https://www.upwork.com/hiring/data/sql-vs-nosql-databases-whats-the-difference/)
em.persists stored the record int the oracle sql database this database is structured using tables the data is stored as a record in the table.
b.The myHashTable.put() " implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value.
To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the objects used as keys must implement the hashCode method and the equals method."(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html)
this method uses a hash table to map the data

Exercise 13.2
b.database keys: Database keys are well structured,identify a record and are stored differently than in a nosql key/
nosql keys:"can be thought of as a single record in a database, where the key is used to locate the value. Both the key and the value 
are application-defined, given some loose restrictions imposed by Oracle NoSQL Database."
kvkeys are split into minor and major keys(https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26161_02/html/GettingStartedGuide/schema.html)

Exercise 13.3
a.
You might generate a mapping that maps a specific key to another specific key
b.Say you are creating a database that contains shipping records and there is a date field for actual ship date this might be null at first to be changed at a later date.

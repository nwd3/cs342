Project
1.	Vision-Statement

  My vision for the database project for CS 342 is the following:
  I have an Etsy business and website that sells handcrafted wood products to hundreds of people each year.  The business has access to hundreds of customer accounts, favorites, and product data.  My plan is to institute a database that can gather the data that has been accumulated on the Etsy site and my website.
  My plan for the database is to use the data I have collected to better understand the priorities of my customers and understand the products that are the most popular.  Further I think I will be able to use this database to generate a better email newsletter to my customers.  
  This manipulation of data will, I feel, be valuable to our business as we seek to serve our customers and maximize our profits.
Some of the manipulation of the data will include creating queries that give us data about our customers and employees as well as providing statistics about some of the orders and feedback we have been receiving as a company.  Further the dndb database will create views that will allow our employees to interact in a safe efficient way with this data.  The database will also include useful procedures to increase the effeciency of adding records to the databaese and updating important records.
  I also believe adding a web application through J2EE is important so I plan on adding useful accessor methods to increase the userfriendliness of accessing the data.  I also will do some research and implementation into nosql as a possible alternate way to store data.

1. Some of the data I made up and some from 'behind the name' random name generator website 
but some of the data is real data from my etsy store.  I plan on adding more real data as I continue with this project.

2.I am in BCNF form. I feel like for this project BCNF is a good form that is not too restrictive but at the same time is restrictive
enough to create the database properly without having conflicts.
Note I chose to create reviews and feedback as seperate tables as that fits into how we actually get data in our business.
Also dndb stands for DNwoodcrafters Database.
employees:
1.employee number->firstName varchar(1400),
	lastname varchar(1300),
	email_address
2.canidate key: employee number
3. the canidate key is on the left hand side of the fd thus the table is in BCNF

part:
1.part_num->quantity integer,
	part_name varchar(1002),
	part_Desc varchar(1002),
	price
2.canidate key: part_num
3. the canidate key is on the left hand side of the fd thus the table is in BCNF

customer
1.cust_num->firstName varchar(1002),
	lastname varchar (1002),
	email_address varchar(2000),

1.part_num->order_num,
	quantity
2.canidate key: part_num
3. the canidate key is on the left hand side of the fd thus the table is in BCNF

Feedback 
1.feedback_id->order_num,
	cust_num,
	feedback
2.canidate key: feedback_id
